## What was the most proud moment for you during this project?

The proudest moment for me during this project was realizing how much I had improved in troubleshooting and problem-solving. Every time I fixed one issue, five more would show up—but instead of feeling overwhelmed, I was able to solve them quickly. Once I got past the initial hurdles of understanding KivyMD and SQL, I reached a point where I could write code that worked without (too many) immediate errors.

## What worked well this time?

Documentation worked much better this time because I had a clearer understanding of the project criteria and required components. Creating flow diagrams was easier thanks to the past projects and failures in flow diagrams. Additionally, developing other diagrams was more manageable because of the examples we worked on in class.


## What will I do different for P4 and the IA?

For P4 and the IA, I will focus on optimizing my code for better efficiency, extensibility, and readability. Another key area for improvement is user testing—I will gather more feedback earlier in the process to refine the UI/UX experience before finalizing the project.

I will also start working on documentation earlier and make it a habit to document every time I work on the code, detailing what I worked on and any issues I encountered, to make the Record of Tasks and time-management easier (by knowing how much time certain implementations take). To improve project planning, I will create a structured plan outlining key features and milestones before diving into coding. Additionally, I will begin coding a bit before finalizing the success criteria to better understand what is realistically achievable within the given timeframe.


## What are 3 (or more) things that I need help with?

1. Better Structuring of Code
2. Balancing Features with Time Constraints – Identifying which features are essential and feasible within the project timeline while ensuring the final product remains high quality and functional.
3. Getting Feedback on Diagrams – Making sure my flowcharts, ER diagrams, systems diagram, and other visuals clearly represent the system. I need help reviewing them to ensure accuracy and completeness.
