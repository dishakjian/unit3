# Criterion A
## Problem definition

Ms U, a food influencer, relies on honest and high-quality reviews to guide her audience. She is frustrated by unreliable ratings, fake reviews, and a lack of personalization in current food critique platforms. Many platforms allow users to rate restaurants without proof of visit, making it easy for trolls, bots, and competitors to manipulate ratings, ultimately reducing credibility. Additionally, current food rating platforms fail to consider individual taste preferences when recommending restaurants or dishes, leading to irrelevant suggestions that do not align with a user's culinary interests. On top of that, limited sorting options prevent users from filtering restaurants based on specific needs such as price range, culinary interests, popularity, or dietary restrictions, restricting their ability to find the best dining experiences efficiently. Another major issue is that users who take the time to write detailed and thoughtful reviews receive little to no recognition, discouraging engagement and lowering the overall quality of contributions.

As a food influencer, Ms. U frequently collaborates with restaurants and producers, gaining insight into their operational challenges. Restaurants rely on customer feedback to refine their offerings, yet they often struggle to extract meaningful insights from unstructured or misleading reviews. Without a way to engage with credible critiques, they face difficulty in addressing genuine concerns while filtering out bad-faith criticism. Meanwhile, food producers play a crucial role in maintaining quality and sustainability in the industry, but their lack of involvement in existing review ecosystems makes it hard for them to adapt to restaurant demands. Ms. U sees how these gaps in communication and credibility negatively impact both businesses and consumers, reinforcing the need for a more interconnected and transparent system that benefits the entire food industry.

## Proposed solution

I chose to develop a desktop application over a website for its stability, performance, and security. Unlike web applications, which require constant internet connectivity and can suffer from network latency, and depends on a server, a desktop app processes data locally, handles large datasets, reducing wait times and improving user experience [[1]](https://www.ifourtechnolab.com/blog/web-app-vs-desktop-app#:~:text=Desktop%20apps%20usually%20offer%20better,you%20prioritize%20speed%20or%20convenience.) [[2]](https://builtbright.io/en/magazine/web-vs-desktop-applications-pros-and-cons/). It also provides enhanced security by enforcing stricter access controls and local encryption, avoiding vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting and SQL injection [[3]](https://www.softwareseni.com/identifying-and-assessing-risks-in-web-and-app-development/) [[4]](https://rubygarage.org/blog/risk-management-in-development).

I chose Python for GUI development due to its readability and cross platform compatibility, making understanding and future modifications easier for stakeholders [[5]](https://serokell.io/blog/python-pros-and-cons) [[6]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-language-advantages-applications/). It is also lightweight compared to lower-level languages like C++ and Java, ensuring efficiency without unnecessary complexity [[7]](https://www.snaplogic.com/glossary/python-vs-java-performance) [[8]](https://lset.uk/blog/unveiling-the-future-of-python-exploring-the-latest-trends-and-innovations-in-2023-and-beyond/) [[9]](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2023/10/future-of-data-science/). 

I chose KivyMD because it provides a modern, visually appealing, and user-friendly interface based on Googleâ€™s Material Design [[10]](https://kivymd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [[11]](https://m2.material.io/design/introduction/). It ensures a smooth and consistent experience across devices, making navigation intuitive and interactions seamless. Unlike **Tkinter**, which has a basic and outdated appearance, KivyMD offers a polished and engaging design that enhances usability[[12]](https://kivy.org/#home) [[13]](https://medium.com/@qasim.coder/python-gui-smackdown-unleashing-the-power-of-tkinter-pyqt-and-kivy-e7b05d0e862).

I chose SQLite for data storage because it is lightweight, serverless, and cost-effective while efficiently handling structured data like user reviews and restaurant details [[14]](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html) [[15]](https://www.epicweb.dev/why-you-should-probably-be-using-sqlite) [[16]](https://www.sqlite.org/aff_short.html). Unlike **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL**, which require a dedicated server and maintenance, SQLite operates locally with minimal setup, making it ideal for a fast and seamless user experience [[17]](https://www.greengeeks.com/blog/sqlite-vs-mysql/#:~:text=Ultimately%2C%20SQLite%20is%20a%20lightweight,go%2Dto%20for%20RDBMS%20solutions.).

## Filter Restaurants function
This function is responsible for filtering and sorting restaurants based on user preferences and displaying them in a user-friendly format. It handles three main filtering options: Price, Rating, and Recommended. The Recommended filter uses the user's taste profile to calculate a personalized recommendation score for each restaurant. Additionally, it supports a search query to filter restaurants by name or description.

```.py
def filter_restaurants(self):
    # I start by retrieving the filter type selected by the user from the filter_spinner widget.
    filter_type = self.ids.filter_spinner.text

    # I also get the search query entered by the user from the search_input widget and convert it to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    search_query = self.ids.search_input.text.lower()

    # I open a connection to the SQLite database using the DatabaseManager class to fetch restaurant data.
    db = DatabaseManager('project.sql')

    # I define a SQL query to select all restaurants' details: id, name, description, rating, price, and photo.
    query = "SELECT id, name, description, rating, price, photo FROM restaurants"

    # I execute the query and store the results in the `restaurants` variable, which will contain a list of tuples.
    restaurants = db.search(query)

    # I close the database connection to free up resources and avoid potential memory leaks.
    db.close()

    # I print the number of restaurants found to the console for debugging purposes.
    print(f"Found {len(restaurants)} restaurants.")

    # I clear the existing restaurant cards from the restaurant_list widget to prepare for displaying the filtered results.
    self.ids.restaurant_list.clear_widgets()

    # I check the filter type selected by the user to determine how to sort the restaurants.
    if filter_type == 'Price':
        # If the filter type is 'Price', I sort the restaurants by their price. 
        # The price is represented by the number of 'Â¥' symbols in the 4th index of the tuple.
        # If the price is None, I default it to 0 to avoid errors during sorting.
        restaurants.sort(key=lambda x: x[4] if x[4] is not None else 0)
    elif filter_type == 'Rating':
        # If the filter type is 'Rating', I sort the restaurants by their rating.
        # The rating is in the 3rd index of the tuple. If it's None, I default it to 0.
        # I sort in descending order (reverse=True) so higher-rated restaurants appear first.

### How It Works - Summary

1. Data Retrieval: The function starts by fetching all restaurants from the database. It then clears the existing UI elements to prepare for displaying the filtered results.

2. Filtering and Sorting:
- If the user selects Price, the restaurants are sorted by their price (represented by the number of 'Â¥' symbols).

- If the user selects Rating, the restaurants are sorted by their rating in descending order.

- If the user selects Recommended, the function calculates a recommendation score for each restaurant based on the user's taste profile and the restaurant's taste profile. The restaurants are then sorted by this score.

3. Search Query Filtering: After sorting, the function filters the restaurants based on the search query entered by the user. It checks if the query matches the restaurant's name or description (case-insensitive).

4. UI Rendering: For each filtered restaurant, the function creates a card that displays the restaurant's name, rating, price, and description. The card also includes a button to view more details about the restaurant.

5. Dynamic Updates: The function dynamically updates the UI to reflect the filtered and sorted results, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Calculate Restaurant Taste Profile Function
This function calculates the taste profile of a restaurant based on the dishes in its reviews. The taste profile is used to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their taste preferences.

```.py
def calculate_restaurant_taste_profile(self, restaurant_id):
    """
    I calculate the taste profile for a restaurant based on the dishes in its reviews.
    """
    # I open a connection to the SQLite database using the DatabaseManager class.
    db = DatabaseManager('project.sql')
    try:
        # I define a SQL query to fetch the taste profiles of all dishes associated with the restaurant's reviews.
        query = """
        SELECT d.sweet, d.salty, d.sour, d.bitter, d.umami
        FROM reviews r
        JOIN dishes d ON r.dish = d.id
        WHERE r.restaurant_id = ?
        """
        # I execute the query and store the results in the `dish_taste_profiles` variable.
        dish_taste_profiles = db.search(query, (restaurant_id,))

        # If no dishes are found, I return a default taste profile with all values set to 0.
        if not dish_taste_profiles:
            return {
                "sweet": 0,
                "salty": 0,
                "sour": 0,
                "bitter": 0,
                "umami": 0,
            }

        # I initialize a dictionary to store the cumulative taste profile.
        taste_profile = {"sweet": 0, "salty": 0, "sour": 0, "bitter": 0, "umami": 0}

        # I iterate over each dish's taste profile to calculate the cumulative taste profile.
        for dish in dish_taste_profiles:
            # I unpack the taste attributes for the current dish.
            sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami = dish

            # I add each taste attribute to the cumulative taste profile.
            taste_profile["sweet"] += sweet
            taste_profile["salty"] += salty
            taste_profile["sour"] += sour
            taste_profile["bitter"] += bitter
            taste_profile["umami"] += umami

        # I normalize the taste profile by dividing each attribute by the number of dishes.
        num_dishes = len(dish_taste_profiles)
        for key in taste_profile:
            taste_profile[key] /= num_dishes

        # I return the normalized taste profile.
        return taste_profile

    except Exception as e:
        # If an error occurs, I print the error message and return a default taste profile.
        print(f"Error calculating taste profile: {e}")
        return {
            "sweet": 0,

            "umami": 0,
        }
    finally:
        # I ensure the database connection is closed, even if an error occurs.
        db.close()
```
### How It Works - Summary
1. Data Retrieval: The function queries the database to fetch the taste profiles of all dishes associated with the restaurant's reviews.

2. Default Handling: If no dishes are found, it returns a default taste profile with all values set to 0.

3. Cumulative Calculation: It iterates over each dish's taste profile and calculates the cumulative taste profile by summing up the taste attributes.

4. Normalization: The cumulative taste profile is normalized by dividing each attribute by the number of dishes.

5. Error Handling: If an error occurs, it prints the error message and returns a default taste profile.

6. Resource Management: The database connection is closed in the finally block to ensure proper resource management.

## Try Login Function
This function handles user login by validating the username, password, and role entered by the user. It also checks if a restaurant user is approved before allowing access.

```.py
def try_login(self):
    # I retrieve the username, password, and role entered by the user from the UI.
    username = self.ids.uname.text
    password = self.ids.passwd.text
    role = self.ids.role_spinner.text

    # I check if the username or password fields are empty.
    if not username or not password:
        # If either field is empty, I show an error message and return.
        self.show_error("Please fill in all fields.")
        return

    # I define a SQL query to search for the user in the database.
    search_user = "SELECT id, username, email, password, role, points FROM users WHERE username = ? AND role = ?"
    # I open a connection to the SQLite database using the DatabaseManager class.
    db = DatabaseManager('project.sql')
    # I execute the query and store the result in the `result` variable.
    result = db.search(search_user, (username, role))

    # I check if exactly one user was found.
    if len(result) == 1:
        # I unpack the user's details from the result.
        user_id, username, email, stored_hash_password, role, points = result[0]

        # I check if the entered password matches the stored hash password.
        if check_hash(input_str=password, hash=stored_hash_password):
            # If the password matches, I store the user's ID and username in the LoginScreen class.
            LoginScreen.current_user = user_id
            LoginScreen.current_username = username

            # If the user is a restaurant, I check if the restaurant is approved.
            if role == "Restaurant":
                # I define a SQL query to fetch the restaurant's approval status.
                restaurant_query = "SELECT approved FROM restaurants WHERE owner_id = ?"
                # I execute the query and store the result in the `restaurant_result` variable.
                restaurant_result = db.search(restaurant_query, (user_id,))
                # I close the database connection.
                db.close()

                # If the restaurant is found, I check its approval status.
                if restaurant_result:
                    approved = restaurant_result[0][0]
                    # I redirect the user to the appropriate screen based on the approval status.
                    self.redirect_to_role_screen(role, approved)
                else:
                    # If the restaurant is not found, I show an error message.
                    self.show_error("Restaurant not found.")
                    return
            else:
                # For non-restaurant roles, I redirect the user directly.
                self.redirect_to_role_screen(role)
        else:
            # If the password does not match, I show an error message.
            db.close()
            self.show_error("Username or password incorrect.")
    else:
        # If no user is found, I show an error message.
        db.close()
        self.show_error("User not found.")
```
### How It Works - Summary
1. Input Validation: The function checks if the username and password fields are filled.

2. Database Query: It queries the database to find a user with the entered username and role.

3. Password Verification: It verifies the entered password against the stored hash password.

4. Role Handling: If the user is a restaurant, it checks if the restaurant is approved before redirecting.

5. Error Handling: It shows appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or database errors.

6. Redirection: It redirects the user to the appropriate screen based on their role and approval status.

## Add Reviews Function
This function allows users to add a review for a restaurant. It validates the input, checks for inappropriate content, and updates the database.
```.py
def add_review(self):
    # I retrieve the dish, rating, and comment entered by the user from the UI.
    dish = self.ids.dish_spinner.text
    rating = self.ids.rating_input.text
    comment = self.ids.comment_input.text

    # I check if any of the fields are empty.
    if not dish or not rating or not comment:
        # If any field is empty, I show an error message and return.
        self.show_error("Please fill in all fields.")
        return

    try:
        # I convert the rating to a float and validate that it is between 1 and 5.
        rating = float(rating)
        if rating < 1 or rating > 5:
            # If the rating is invalid, I show an error message and return.
            self.show_error("Rating must be between 1 and 5.")
            return
    except ValueError:
        # If the rating is not a number, I show an error message and return.
        self.show_error("Rating must be a number.")
        return

    # I check if the comment contains inappropriate content.
    flagged_reason = self.check_for_inappropriate_content(comment)
    if flagged_reason:
        # If the comment is flagged, I show an error message and send the review for moderation.
        self.show_error(
            f"Your message was flagged as inappropriate and was sent for review. Reason: {flagged_reason}. TasteTogether is a platform for collaboration, sharing experiences, and improving the food industry. Help us keep our safe space!")
        self.send_for_review(dish, rating, comment, flagged_reason)
        return

    # I open a connection to the SQLite database using the DatabaseManager class.
    db = DatabaseManager('project.sql')

    # I retrieve the current user's ID from the LoginScreen class.
    user_id = LoginScreen.current_user
    if not user_id:
        # If the user ID is not found, I show an error message and return.
        db.close()
        self.show_error("User not found. Please log in again.")
        return

    # I insert the new review into the reviews table.
    query = "INSERT INTO reviews (restaurant_id, user_id, dish, rating, comment) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)"
    db.execute(query, (self.restaurant_id, user_id, dish, rating, comment))

    # I update the restaurant's rating in the database.
    self.update_restaurant_rating(self.restaurant_id, rating)

    # I close the database connection.
    db.close()

    # I clear the input fields to prepare for the next review.
    self.ids.dish_spinner.text = "Select Dish"
    self.ids.rating_input.text = ""
    self.ids.comment_input.text = ""

    # I reload the reviews to reflect the new addition.
    self.load_restaurant(self.restaurant_id)
```

### How It Works - Summary
1. Input Validation: The function checks if all fields are filled and validates the rating.

2. Inappropriate Content Check: It checks if the comment contains inappropriate content and flags it if necessary.

3. Database Insertion: It inserts the new review into the database and updates the restaurant's rating.

4. Error Handling: It shows appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or database errors.

5. UI Update: It clears the input fields and reloads the reviews to reflect the new addition.

## Load Flagged Reviews Function
This function loads flagged reviews from the database and displays them in the UI for moderators to review. Moderators can either approve or reject flagged reviews.
```.py
def load_flagged_reviews(self):
    # I open a connection to the SQLite database using the DatabaseManager class.
    db = DatabaseManager('project.sql')

    # I define a SQL query to fetch all flagged reviews along with the username of the user who posted the review.
    query = """

    # I execute the query and store the results in the `flagged_reviews` variable.
    flagged_reviews = db.search(query)

    # I close the database connection to free up resources.
    db.close()

    # I clear the existing flagged reviews from the UI to prepare for displaying the new ones.
    self.ids.flagged_reviews.clear_widgets()

    # I iterate over each flagged review to create a UI element for it.

        review_box.add_widget(approve_btn)
        review_box.add_widget(reject_btn)

        # I add the review_box to the flagged_reviews widget to display it on the screen.
        self.ids.flagged_reviews.add_widget(review_box)
```

### How It Works
1. Data Retrieval: The function queries the database to fetch all flagged reviews along with the username of the user who posted the review.

2. UI Clearing: It clears the existing flagged reviews from the UI to prepare for displaying the new ones.

3. UI Rendering: For each flagged review, it creates a BoxLayout to display the review details and adds "Approve" and "Reject" buttons.

4. Button Actions: The buttons are linked to functions that handle the approval or rejection of the review.

5. Resource Management: The database connection is closed after fetching the data.

## Approve Review Function
```.py
def approve_review(self, review_id):
    # I open a connection to the SQLite database using the DatabaseManager class.
    db = DatabaseManager('project.sql')

    try:
        # I fetch the restaurant_id associated with the flagged review.
        restaurant_id = db.search("SELECT restaurant_id FROM flagged_reviews WHERE id = ?", (review_id,))[0][0]

        # I fetch the details of the flagged review.
        flagged_review = db.search("SELECT user_id, dish, rating, comment FROM flagged_reviews WHERE id = ?", (review_id,))[0]

        # I move the approved review to the general reviews table.
        db.execute("INSERT INTO reviews (restaurant_id, user_id, dish, rating, comment) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)",
                   (restaurant_id, flagged_review[0], flagged_review[1], flagged_review[2], flagged_review[3]))

        # I delete the review from the flagged_reviews table.
        db.execute("DELETE FROM flagged_reviews WHERE id = ?", (review_id,))

        # I commit the changes to the database.
        db.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        # If an error occurs, I print the error message.
        print(f"Error approving review: {e}")
    finally:
        # I ensure the database connection is closed, even if an error occurs.
        db.close()

    # I reload the flagged reviews to reflect the changes.
    self.load_flagged_reviews()
```
### How It Works - Summary
1. Data Retrieval: The function fetches the restaurant ID and review details from the flagged_reviews table.

2. Review Approval: It inserts the review into the reviews table and deletes it from the flagged_reviews table.

3. Error Handling: If an error occurs, it prints the error message.

4. Resource Management: The database connection is closed in the finally block.

5. UI Update: The flagged reviews are reloaded to reflect the changes.
